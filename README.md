# BlackSheet
Cheat sheet for Blackjack actions based on player's hand and dealer's upcard

## How to Launch

To run the program, use:

```bash
python3 BlackSheet.py
```
or
```bash
python BlackSheet.py
```

You will be prompted to enter three cards:
1. **First card:** Player's first card
2. **Second card:** Dealer's upcard
3. **Third card:** Player's second card

The program will then calculate the recommended action based on the Toto cheatsheet.
